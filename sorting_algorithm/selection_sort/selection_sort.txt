Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by
repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted
portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2) as there are two nested loops
Auxiliary Space: O(1) as the only extra memory used is for temporary variables

Advantages of Selection Sort Algorithm
Simple and easy to understand.
Works well with small datasets.

Disadvantages of the Selection Sort Algorithm
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
Does not work well on large datasets.
Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.
